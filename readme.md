Welcome to the bioinfo-genomic-determinants-of-pathogenicity wiki!

This project is meant to replicate/investigate the work of Gussow et al on finding regions within different Coronavirus genomes that determine their pathogenicity (how pathogenic they can get) using Machine Learning and Bioinformatics.

Findings suggest that genomic regions on each family's spike protein are one of the more causative factors on Coronavirus pathogenicity in different Coronavirus families.

ML concepts applied: SVMs, Moving Window, Principal Component Analysis, K-Means Clustering.
Bioinformatics concepts applied: Multiple sequence alignment
